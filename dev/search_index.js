The Collision Probability Method (CP) and the Method of Characteristics (MOC) are among these formulations. Both of them compute the scalar flux over well-discretized energy and region meshes that is later used to obtain homogenized cross sections for core-level calculations.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"At first, representative lattices used to be unique 2D square pin cells geometries. Nowadays, with the increment of computing power, lattice domains became arrangements of pin cells that may represent one or many fuel elements. Collision Probability methods can handle these complex geometries but they become impractical as the numer of regions increases. On the other hand, over the last years, the Method of Characteristics gain particular interest because it can handle fuel arrangements or even complete cores, overcoming CP limitations.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Method-of-Characteristics","page":"Home","title":"Method of Characteristics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The Method of Characteristics (MOC) was the selected formulation since it overcomes the main limitation for the Collision Probability (CP) method: it does not produce full square matrices of order equal to the number of regions in the domain times the energy groups, so it is possible to solve problems with many more regions.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In this context, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for unstructured meshes (see RayTracing.jl) was developed in first place.
